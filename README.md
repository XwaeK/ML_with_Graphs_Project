   [ArXiv Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04090)

2. **Related paper (Comparison Section of the Report):**  
   _"Inpainting-Driven Graph Learning via Explainable Neural Networks"_  
   [ArXiv Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10756724)

---

## ðŸ”¹ Oral Presentation Guidelines

- **Timing:** Strictly 10 minutes for both speakers combined.  
- **Questions:** Prepare short, direct answers (< 1 min per question).  
- **Both team members must be ready** to answer any technical questions.  
- **No reading scripts**, speak freely and naturally.  
- **Focus on:**
  - Technical contributions.
  - Novelty and relevance to the literature.
  - Experimental results supporting the claims.
  - The additional experiment we reproduced (discussion).

---

## ðŸ”¹ Report Guidelines

The report is divided into two sections:  
1. **Paper 1 summary:**  
   - Main contributions.  
   - Related works (brief).  
   - Overview of the methodology (GLR, GTV, optimization).  
   - Key experimental results.

2. **Paper 2 comparison:**  
   - Justify the choice of this paper.  
   - Brief summary of Paper 2.  
   - Relation to Paper 1 (similarities/differences).  

- **Format:** ICML 2025 template ([Overleaf link](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/icml2025-template/dhxrkcgkvnkt))  
- **Length:** 4 pages max (excluding references).  
- **Figures/tables:** Only the most relevant.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Experiment Reproduction 

- **Reproduce at least one key experiment** from Paper 1:  
  - Report the experimental setup: settings, code version, datasets used.  
  - Analyze results compared to those reported in the paper.  
  - If reproduction fails, provide a detailed explanation (e.g., Out-Of-Memory, hardware limitations, or implementation issues).

- **Propose and perform an additional experiment**, as required:  
  - This is mandatory for the final grade.  
  - Include a discussion of the new experiment in the final report -> Appendix !
  - Possible directions ?:  
    - Ablation study (e.g., number of layers, regularizer effect).  
    - Applying the model to another dataset.  
    - Varying hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, neighborhood size).  
    - Testing model robustness (e.g., noise injection).  
    - Etc.
